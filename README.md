Jenkins and related Docker files for the BHIMA end-to-end test server

These directions assume Ubuntu LTS, but should be easily adapted to any Debian-based distro.

Note that this test server  runs Jenkins in a docker container, so it requires Docker.

1. Update your installation
   `sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y`
2. Install Docker
   - See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

3. Download the  Jenkins docker image
4.
